```

### ‚ùå What Failure Looks Like:

```
=== FINAL RESULTS ===
Compilation:      15/15 points
Test Cases:       40/80 points  (2/4 tests passed)
Code Quality:      5/5 points
FINAL SCORE:      60/100 points
PERCENTAGE:            60%
Letter Grade: D
```

### üîç How to Debug Issues:

**Compilation Failed:**

- Check for missing semicolons
- Make sure you have `#include <stdio.h>`
- Verify all brackets `{}` are matched

**Test Case Failed:**

- Check the expected output format exactly
- Make sure you're reading input correctly with `scanf`
- Verify your calculations are correct

**Timeout/Crash:**

- Avoid infinite loops
- Initialize all variables
- Check for division by zero

## Sample Working Solution

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int a, b;
    
    // Read two integers
    scanf("%d %d", &a, &b);
    
    // Calculate and output results
    printf("%d\n", a + b);      // sum
    printf("%d\n", a - b);      // difference  
    printf("%d\n", a * b);      // product
    
    return 0;
}
```

## Submission Tips

### ‚úÖ DO:

- Start early and submit multiple times
- Test with the provided examples
- Read error messages carefully
- Ask for help during office hours

### ‚ùå DON'T:

- Wait until the last minute
- Share your code with other students
- Copy solutions from the internet
- Submit without testing

## Getting Help

1. **Check the assignment README** for examples and requirements
2. **Look at the test results** in the Actions tab for specific errors
3. **Ask questions** during office hours or on the course forum
4. **Test locally** if you have a C compiler installed

## Academic Integrity Reminder

- Write your own code
- Don't share your repository with other students
- Don't copy from online sources
- Collaboration on concepts is OK, but code must be your own

**Good luck with your assignment!**
