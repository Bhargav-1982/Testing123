# ðŸ˜º GitHub Classroom Setup Practice
This assignment is designed to get you familiar with GitHub Classroom assignment submission and grading. Please refer to the instructor-provided document "GUIDE â€“ How to Submit an Assignment on GitHub" and the video tutorial links on the Canvas course page to understand the steps in detail. Please note that this is not a graded assignment.

## Objective
Write a C program that reads two integers and performs basic arithmetic operations.

## Problem Description
Your program should:
1. Read two integers from standard input
2. Calculate and output their sum, difference, and product
3. Handle the operations correctly for all integer inputs

## Requirements
- Use these GCC compiler flags:  `gcc -std=c17 -Wall -Wextra -Werror -pedantic -g -O0`
- Read input using: `scanf()`
- Output results using: `printf()`
- Handle both positive and negative integers
- Follow good programming practices

## Input Format
Two integers separated by whitespace on a single line.

## Output Format
Three lines containing:
1. The sum of the two integers
2. The difference (first integer minus second integer)
3. The product of the two integers

## Examples

### Example 1
**Input:**
```
5 3
```
**Output:**
```
8
2
15
```

### Example 2
**Input:**
```
-10 7
```
**Output:**
```
-3
-17
-70
```

### Example 3
**Input:**
```
0 100
```
**Output:**
```
100
-100
0
```

## Submission Instructions
1. Edit the file `student_solution.c` with your implementation
2. Test your code locally if possible
3. Commit and push your changes to submit
4. Check the "Actions" tab to see your autograder results
5. You can submit multiple times before the deadline

## Grading Breakdown
- **Compilation (15 points)**: Your code must compile without errors
- **Test Cases (80 points)**: Your program must produce correct output for all test cases
- **Code Quality (5 points)**: Basic style and safety checks
- **Late Penalty**: -20 points if submitted after deadline

## Getting Help
- Test your code with the provided examples
- Make sure your output format matches exactly (no extra text)
- Check for common issues: missing semicolons, incorrect printf format
- Ask questions during office hours

## Academic Integrity
- Write your own code
- Do not share your solution with other students
- You may discuss the problem approach but not share actual code
- All submissions are automatically checked for similarity

**Good luck!**
